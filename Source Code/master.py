# This Python script logs data from a Raspberry Pi 4 connected to a sensor array, and logs the information (along with time and date) to a CSV file once a minute.  
# It will serve as the foundation for a fully-independent IoT enabled weather station which will be mounted to a permanent fixture outdoors and feature a wider
# array of sensors, including a custom-built electronic wind vane and anemometer, ultraviolet indexer, and weatherproof camera.
# For now, it only has basic capability of taking readings of the local temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and logging it to a custom CSV file at 
# regular intervals. The list of sensors used follows:
#
# Adafruit AM2303 (wired variant of the DHT22) temperature and humidity sensor: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/393]
# Adafruit DPS310 precision barometer and altimeter: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/4494] 
# Adafruit SI1145 ultraviolet and visible light indexer (not active in this build): [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1777]
#
# You can also access .STL files for 3D printing hardware, KiCAD schematics for custom sensors, and additional scripts and documentation at the project's dedicated
# GitHub repository: [https://github.com/AlexFlamand/RaspiWeatherStation]
